You are an expert resume writer with over 20 years of experience. I need help crafting a precise and clear bullet point for my resume. Please follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure the bullet point is **relevant**, **believable**, and **professional**.
2. Use **metrics** in more than 70% of the bullet points, ensuring they are **meaningful** and **accurate**.
3. **Reorder the bullet points** to highlight the most impactful achievement first.
4. Follow the **XYZ formula**: 
   - **Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z**.
   - Example: "Drove 2,500 organic signups to our monthly newsletters by AB Testing content layout and collaborating with co-marketing partners, resulting in a 43% increase."
5. Ensure the bullet point is **precise** and **clear**, avoiding unnecessary words.
6. Use **appropriate tense** based on the timeframe (e.g., past or present).
7. Avoid **complicated language**; keep it simple and direct.
